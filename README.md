There's still plenty I plan to do with this project. Some ideas are listed below:

- Add anime.js animations to homepage and gameroom

  - Flipping card animation for buttons on homescreen and cards in gameroom
  
  - Moving character images in and out of homepage
  
  - Draw and place card animations in gameroom
  
- Create some functions for card interaction

- Demo mode to show functionality and idea of how to play for those who aren't familiar with Yu-Gi-Oh
