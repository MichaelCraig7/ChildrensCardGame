# Yu-Gi-Oh App


#### Live site: https://childrenscardgame.herokuapp.com/

Going into this project, my goal was to create something fun that I would be able to continuously work on for a long time to come.  Yu-Gi-Oh, like Pokemon or Hearthstone, is a card game where two players use a strategically constructed deck to reduce their opponent's health, or Life Points, to zero.  Because there are around 9000 Yu-Gi-Oh cards, I could spend years developing the functionality for how each card works.

For the first week of development, I decided that creating a player's ability to enter a gameroom with another player and see each others' interactions was the most important piece to get up and running.  Though this took more time than I expected, eventually

### Future Iterations


There's still plenty I plan to do with this project. Some ideas are listed below:

- Add anime.js animations to homepage and gameroom

  - Flipping card animation for buttons on homescreen and cards in gameroom
  
  - Moving character images in and out of homepage
  
  - Draw and place card animations in gameroom
  
- Create some functions for card interaction

- Demo mode to show functionality and idea of how to play for those who aren't familiar with Yu-Gi-Oh
